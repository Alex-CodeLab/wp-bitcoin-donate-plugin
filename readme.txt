== Description ==

The popover needs Bootstrap CSS (and jQuery) to work correctly.

= What about security? =

No 3rd-party or Exchange is used to store or process your bitcoin, but it is send directly to your wallet.
This is the most secure way to receive Bitcoins, since you don't have to 'trust' and 3rd-party.
Exchanges and payment-processors are the weakest link in bitcoin security, so they should be avoided.
That is why Donations should go directly to your personal wallet, and not stored somewhere online.
